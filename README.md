# UFOs

### Javascript, Bootstrap

## Overview of Project: 
  The purpose of the this project was to set up an HTML website for Dana. She wanted to be able to provide a deeper analysis for website users when they are searching for UFO sightings. The users will be able to filter their search results based on specific criteria such as city, date, state, country or shape of the sighgtings. 
  
## Results: 
  Users will find the webpage, for the most part, easy to navigate. They can easily search by certain filters if they have something in mind such as what country or the date of the sighting. They can even filter what shapes were seen by eye witnesses in such sightings. If they know all of the details, they can search by date, city, state, country and shape which should bring up the exact UFO sighting they may be looking for. 

## Summary: 
  The only drawback in this new design would be if someone doesn't exactly know what they are looking for and want just general information regarding the sightings. Two recommendations would be to add just a general search button so you don't have to add information. Another recommendation would be to add in more search filters such as duration.
